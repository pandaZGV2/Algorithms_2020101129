# Lecture 1

We discussed steps to finding out better and better solutions to computational problems. They are:

- Identify the problem. Is it computational?
- Is the solution correct? Is it efficient?
- Can we do better? Compare two solutions to the same problem.
- Prove the solution is optimum ie - we cannot do better than this solution.

We defined computational problems and computational solutions, and found that every problem can be modelled as a decision problem or multiple sub-problems that are also decision problems. By doing so we can eleminate the defficulties associated with computational problems such as the ability to pose the same problem in multiple ways.

We then discussed what makes an algorithm an algorithm before listing the axioms of computation.

The axioms of computation are:

- It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations.
- Only finite amount of information can be stored in a finite volume.
- A finite length code exerts a finite amount of control.

As long as a machine makes only these three assumptions it can be simulated using a turing machine.

We then discussed how we compare solutions (based on time and space) and what makes a solution better.
