# Lecture 1

We discussed steps to finding out better and better solutions to computational problems. They are:

- Identify the problem. Is it computational?
- Is the solution correct? Is it efficient?
- Can we do better? Compare two solutions to the same problem.
- Prove the solution is optimum ie - we cannot do better than this solution.

We defined computational problems and computational solutions, and found that every problem can be modelled as a decision problem or multiple sub-problems that are also decision problems. By doing so we can eleminate the defficulties associated with computational problems such as the ability to pose the same problem in multiple ways.

We then discussed what makes an algorithm an algorithm before listing the axioms of computation.

The axioms of computation are:

- It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations.
- Only finite amount of information can be stored in a finite volume.
- A finite length code exerts a finite amount of control.

As long as a machine makes only these three assumptions it can be simulated using a turing machine.

We then discussed how we compare solutions (based on time and space) and what makes a solution better.

# Lecture 2

We proved how certain problems cannot be solved even by computers programs and even computers of the future is the Church-Turing Hypothesis is true.

We showed that the total number of programs (as per class in the C language) is countable. We showed a 1-1 correspondence between ${0,1}*$ and $\mathbb{N}$ by listing the strings in short-lex order. This indicates that the set of finite length bit strings is countable.

The set of programs (solutions to the problem) is a subset of ${0,1}*$ as the programs are of finite length since they occupy finite amount of memory. This implies that the set of programs is also countable.

We then proved that the power set of ${0,1}*$ is uncountable using cantors diagonalization argument. Since problems can be defined as membership queries in languages, the set of all problems has the same cardinality as P({0,1}*). Hence the set of all problems is uncountable.

Since the number of problems is more than the number of possible programs, there are non-computable problems.

We then discussed the chruch-turing hypothesis before formally defining a turing machine.

A Turing Machine can be defined as a 7-tuple of the form $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta,q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$, where Q is the finite set of states, $\Sigma$ is the finite input alphabet set, $\Gam_ma$ is the transition function, $q_0$ is the start state, $q_{accept}$ is the accept state and $q_{reject}$ is the reject state.
